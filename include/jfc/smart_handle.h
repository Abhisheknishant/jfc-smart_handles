    /// \brief provides automatic based mechanism for cleanup of "handle types"
    /// a handle is responsible for some sort of manual state managemnet at end of life. e.g: OpenGL/AL buffer handles, LibClang nodes
    /// Deleter will only be called once: when final the copy of the smart handle goes out of scope.
    /// Implementation based on final_action found in the Cpp General Guidelines, extended to strongly associate the handle with the deletor (both are members) and to support copy operations in addition to moves
    /// analogous to stl shared_ptr
    /// This is a "Thread friendly" object. const methods are safe. Care must be taken around the end of life, however. For example, if an instance is destructing such that use_count returns 1 just before some other thread increments the count, the deleter will be invoked, which will turn the new instance on the other thread a zombie. This is because smart_ptr<>::use_count is not explicitly synchronized. This can be detected (count will then return 0). I believe this is an acceptable edgecase and would rather warn about end of life issue rather than introduce a mutex.
